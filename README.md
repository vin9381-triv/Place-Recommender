# Place Recommender System

Welcome to the Place Recommender System project! This project combines the power of machine learning with a simple web interface to recommend interesting places based on user input. The system utilizes the Flask web framework, a bit of machine learning magic, and basic HTML/CSS styling.

## How It Works

1. **Data and Machine Learning Magic:**
   The project starts by collecting data about various places and their descriptions. The machine learning part comes into play using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization. This technique helps the system understand the significance of words in each place's description. Using KMeans clustering, places are grouped into two clusters based on similarities in their descriptions.

2. **Flask - The Web Framework:**
   Flask is a lightweight web framework that forms the backbone of this project. It provides the structure needed to create a web application. When the user accesses the website, a simple homepage is displayed.

3. **HTML and CSS - The Frontend Style:**
   The visual aspect of the project is built using HTML and CSS. HTML structures the webpage, defining where elements like input boxes and buttons appear. CSS adds styling, making the webpage visually appealing with colors, spacing, and other design elements.

4. **Getting Recommendations:**
   Users input a description of a place and select a state. When they hit the "Submit" button, their input is processed by the recommender function. This function leverages the machine learning clustering model and filters places based on the user's input.

5. **Displaying Recommendations:**
   The recommendations, the top five places matching the user's preferences, are displayed on the webpage in a neat table format. Each recommendation includes the place's name, state, and rating.

6. **Next Steps and Improvements:**
   This project serves as a starting point. Consider adding error handling to enhance the user experience and security measures to ensure safe input. Documentation within the code will help other developers understand your work. This project is an exciting dive into basic machine learning and web development.

## Code Explanation

- `app.py`: This Python script is the heart of the project. It loads data from an Excel file, applies TF-IDF vectorization and KMeans clustering to group places, and defines the Flask routes for the web application.

- `index.html`: This HTML file is the template for the homepage of the website. It contains an input form where users can enter a description and select a state.

## Getting Started

1. Install required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install Flask pandas numpy scikit-learn
   ```

2. Run the Flask application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

3. Access the website at `http://localhost:5000` in your browser.
